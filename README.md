# File System

Created for future reference. In each folder, there are 3 sub folders:
- Lab Documents
    - Contains all lab documents that are given by Dr. York
- Project
    - Contains entire project and workspace for PSoC Creator
- Report
    - Contains all necessary information for the report, will be given in both .docx, .odt, and .pdf format.
- Possible Issues
    - Known issues or possible issues for the project
- Notes
    - Notes for the project, helps for the small quiz he gives us during the demo.

# For Future Reference

Eventually, all labs will be named accordingly, but don't want to jump ahead. GIT should auto update those names accordingly without many issues.

# Before you PUSH to the Repository

Make sure to pull any updated files up to your local repository before pushing content to the repository.
