1. Figure out parts
    4x20 LCD
        https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Interface-Adapter-Backlight-Raspberry/dp/B07QLRD3TM/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2N3E0VL0ZZ0ZM&keywords=4x20+LCD&qid=1676004032&sprefix=4x20+lcd%2Caps%2C206&sr=8-6
    Speaker
        Steal from lab
    LEDs
        Already have
    RTC (Real time clock) I2C interface
        https://www.amazon.com/Module-PCF8563-PCF8563T-Accuracy-1-0-5-5V/dp/B07XRYFV28/ref=sr_1_9?crid=3W2YOTM03L0TT&keywords=rtc+i2c+with+battery&qid=1676004187&sprefix=rtc+i2c+with+battery%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-9
    Mechanical Encoder (for how much food)
        Already have
    UART (either through computer terminal or web app) - setting time
    Motors - Note: figure out which motors to use

    Power supply
        ARC Lab
    Barrel jack connectors
        https://www.amazon.com/Connector-Barrel-Adapter-Security-Camera/dp/B09S3S6RYC/ref=sr_1_8?crid=2PZ1L6P4J1RU2&keywords=barrel+jack+connector&qid=1676005045&s=electronics&sprefix=barrel+jack+connector%2Celectronics%2C98&sr=1-8
    Step-down converter
        https://www.amazon.com/UCTRONICS-Converter-Transformer-Voltage-Regulator/dp/B07XXWQ49N/ref=sr_1_3?crid=LQWHRQYBF6X&keywords=buck+converter+12V+to+5V&qid=1676005201&s=electronics&sprefix=buck+converter+12v+to+5v%2Celectronics%2C91&sr=1-3
2. Get mechanical parts done, 3d modeling, 3d printing
    Wheel
    Door (might not need motor)
    Hinge
    Enclosure for wiring
    Below wiring enclosure, have enclosure for weights or mounting
    Enclosure for motors and other stuff
    Enclosure for LCD and encoder
    Top for food insertion - threaded
    Container for food insertion - threaded
    Rubber feet for bottom
3. Figure out circuitry
    12V to 5V conversion
    Get LCD to print what we need it to, along with encoder
    Get motors working for door (might not be needed)
    Get motors working for wheel
    Get I2C for RTC working
    Get UART working properly, store values
    Get LED's and Speaker working
4. Put everything together
5. Get web app working??
